\item Co-convener \dzero~low-mass Higgs group, consisting of roughly
forty members.  Under my leadership, obtained first evidence for $VZ$ production 
with $Z\to b{\bar b}$ (I was primary\ analyzer for the $\ell\ell b{\bar b}$ input to
this result), and in combination with CDF, of $H\to b{\bar b}$.  Led effort to publish
final \dzero~Higgs search papers on full Run~II data set of 9.7 fb$^{-1}$.
\item Leader of \dzero~$ZH\to\ell\ell b{\bar b}$ analysis team, consisting
of three students, five postdocs and four senior scientists.  Primary developer of
analysis software for all stages of analysis. Pioneered initial development of multivariate 
discriminant to suppress $t{\bar t}$ background, and supervised student in its completion.
\item I provided the \dzero~$\ell\ell b{\bar b}$ inputs to articles on
  combined \dzero, and combined Tevatron constraints on the spin and parity of the Higgs
  boson.
\item Dissertation based on search for technicolor (an alternative
to the standard model description of electroweak symmetry breaking) in
the $\rho_{TC} \to W \pi_{TC} \to \mu\nu b{\overline b}/ b{\overline c}$
channel.  Designed a random grid search to obtain separately optimized analyses
for each of 20 mass hypotheses.
%\indent Undergraduate honors thesis based on calculations of
%production cross sections for a Higgs boson plus jets in gluon fusion
%processes.  Work resulted in two papers, one for a standard model
%Higgs and one for a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, as predicted by
%multi-Higgs doublet models such as supersymmetry.

\item Deputy-leader and later leader of the  NO$\nu$A module
 factory quality assurance team, consisting two postdocs, two
 computer scientists and several undergraduates.  Factory employed
 several hundred undergraduates to construct more than 11,000 modules
 over the course of three years.  Developed software tools for
 monitoring waste rates during module construction.  Maintained factory 
 database used to track module construction and status.  Initiated use of
 electronic logbook to track activities at module factory.  Determined
 acceptable levels of defects for modules used in the NO$\nu$A near and far
 detectors.  
\item Jointly led silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) operations group.
  Streamlined operations and eliminated leading causes of deadtime
  from SMT.  Developed tool for real-time monitoring of SMT hit
  efficiency.  I planned and led a major repair effort to
  recover disabled SMT sensors on a tight schedule.  Key player in
  followup efforts during subsquent shutdowns.  Resulted in highest
  fraction of active SMT channels in \dzero~history an established new
  trend of stability in SMT operations.
\item On call expert for \dzero~fiber tracker and silicon microstrip
  tracker.  Responsibilities included rapid diagnosis and
  resolution of detector problems, and training of shifters.
\item Developed firmware for data transmission in \dzero~central track
  trigger (CTT). Primary player in timing CTT into \dzero~trigger and
  data-acquisition system.
\item Partcipated in design, construction and calibration of
  \dzero~forward preshower (FPS) calibration system.  Developed DAQ
  and analysis software for calibration test stand.
